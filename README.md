This repository hosts the model and analysis code for the MNRAS paper "Using in-situ solar-wind observations to generate inner-boundary conditions to outer-heliosphere simulations, 1: Dynamic time warping applied to synthetic observations" by Owens & Nichols

Data and summary plots for Paper 1 are generated by running the script "OuterHeliosphere_InnerBoundaryFromInSitu_CarrLong.py"

Additional metrics analysis and plots (Figure 11 in Paper 1) can then be generated with "OuterHeliosphere_InnerBoundaryFromInSitu_metrics.py"
